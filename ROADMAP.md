# Genesis Engine: Lexicon - Project Roadmap

This document outlines the ambitious vision for Lexicon. It is a living blueprint for transforming a simple generator into a sophisticated linguistic and cultural simulation engine. Our goal is not just to create words, but to breathe life into the civilizations that speak them.

The roadmap is divided into thematic milestones, each building upon the last to create a tool of unparalleled depth and realism.

---

## ‚úÖ **Phase 1: The Phonetic Clay (Pre-Alpha)**
*Focus: Forging the raw sounds and structures of language.*

- [x] Core `Phoneme` data structure
- [x] `PhoneticInventory` to manage a language's sound palette
- [X] **Configurable Phonotactics:** User-defined rules for syllable structure (e.g., CVC, CCV) and illegal sound combinations.
- [ ] **Prosody & Stress Engine:** Basic rules for word stress and intonation patterns (e.g., iambic, trochaic), giving the language a natural rhythm.
- [ ] **Morphological Generator:** An engine to create a vast lexicon of root words based on the defined phonetics.
- [X] **CLI Interface:** Full command-line control for generation and data export.

## ‚è≥ **Phase 2: The Grammatical Skeleton (Alpha)**
*Focus: Assembling the rules that govern meaning and structure.*

- [ ] **Configurable Grammar Engine:** Define core grammatical properties like word order (SVO, SOV, VSO), noun cases (nominative, accusative), verb aspects (perfective, imperfective), and more.
- [ ] **Derivational Morphology:** A powerful affix system (prefixes, suffixes, infixes) to derive new words from existing roots (e.g., 'run' -> 'runner', 'rerun').
- [ ] **Etymological Graph:** Track the "family tree" of every word, showing how complex words evolved from simpler roots.
- [ ] **"The Schism" - Language Evolution Engine:** Simulate thousands of years of linguistic drift. Apply configurable sound change rules to evolve a single proto-language into a family of distinct daughter languages.

## ‚è≥ **Phase 3: The Cultural Flesh (Beta)**
*Focus: Connecting language to the world it inhabits.*

- [ ] **Cultural Lexicon Module:** Simulate how a culture's environment and values shape its vocabulary. A seafaring culture will independently develop a rich lexicon for boats, stars, and tides; a mountain culture for stone, snow, and altitudes.
- [ ] **Naming Engine:** Generate consistent, meaningful names for people, places, and kingdoms based on the language's grammar and cultural values.
- [ ] **Conceptual Metaphor System:** Define core metaphors (e.g., "ARGUMENT IS WAR," "TIME IS MONEY") that influence idiomatic expressions and abstract vocabulary.
- [ ] **Native GUI:** A clean, intuitive graphical interface to manage these complex systems.
- [ ] **First Paid Release:** Launch on Itch.io/Gumroad with one-click installers.

## üöÄ **Phase 4: The Living History (Release 1.0+)**
*Focus: Simulating the deep history and artifacts of a language.*

- [ ] **Writing System Generator:** Procedurally generate unique scripts (alphabets, syllabaries, abjads) for your languages.
- [ ] **"The Diaspora" - Dialect Simulator:** Simulate how a language fractures into regional dialects based on social strata and geographic isolation. This system will be designed to optionally import topographical and political data from external map files for enhanced realism.
- [ ] **Historical Text Generator:** Generate plausible historical texts, poems, and royal decrees that reflect the language's own evolved grammar and cultural lexicon. This module will be designed to optionally import key events from external history logs.
- [ ] **Plugin & Modding API:** Allow users to extend the engine with their own custom generation and simulation modules.
- [ ] **Long-Term Vision: The Genesis Engine Ecosystem:** The ultimate goal is for Lexicon to become a cornerstone of a larger suite of interconnected creative tools, allowing for seamless, two-way data flow with future worldbuilding applications.

*This roadmap is a declaration of intent. It is ambitious by design. The journey is long, but every commit is a step toward this vision.*
