## About The Project

Lexicon is the first tool in the **Genesis Engine** suite. It is designed from the ground up to be a powerful, offline-first tool for creating deep, evolving, and believable constructed languages (conlangs).

Unlike web-based tools that lock you into subscriptions and limit your creativity, Lexicon is built on a philosophy of user sovereignty and performance. It runs on your machine, it's fast, and you own it forever.

## Status: Pre-Alpha

This project is in the very early stages of development. The core architecture is being built. Features are experimental and subject to change. Follow the journey as it's built in the open!

## Roadmap / Features

- [x] Core `Phoneme` data structure
- [ ] Definable phonetic inventory (the sounds of the language)
- [ ] Syllable structure rules (e.g., CVC, CV, VC)
- [ ] Word generation based on phonetic and syllable rules
- [ ] Basic grammar rule system (e.g., SVO, SOV word order)
- [ ] Language evolution module (simulating sound changes over time)
