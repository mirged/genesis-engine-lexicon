A high-performance linguistic simulation engine for worldbuilders, authors, and game developers. Built in Rust.

## About The Project

Lexicon is the cornerstone of the **Genesis Engine** suite. It is not just a word generator; it is a sophisticated, offline-first simulation engine designed to create languages with unparalleled depth, history, and realism.

Unlike web-based tools that rent you access, Lexicon is built on a philosophy of user sovereignty and performance. It runs on your machine, it's blazingly fast, and it's yours forever.

## The Vision

This project is guided by an ambitious, long-term roadmap. The goal is to simulate the entire lifecycle of a language, from its core sounds to its cultural soul.

*   **Phase 1 (The Foundation):** Forge the raw phonetic and grammatical building blocks.
*   **Phase 2 (The Engine):** Simulate thousands of years of linguistic evolution, creating entire language families from a single ancestor.
*   **Phase 3 (The Culture):** Connect language to its environment and speakers, generating vocabulary that feels authentic and lived-in.
*   **Phase 4 (The History):** Generate unique writing systems, regional dialects, and plausible historical artifacts.

For a detailed breakdown of all planned features, please see the full **[Project Roadmap](ROADMAP.md)**.

## Status: Pre-Alpha

This project is in the very early stages of development. The core architecture is being built in the open. Features are experimental and subject to change.

## Building from Source

This project is built with Rust. If you have the Rust toolchain installed, you can build it yourself.

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mirged/genesis-engine-lexicon.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd genesis-engine-lexicon
    ```
3.  Build and run the project:
    ```sh
    cargo run
    ```

## Official Releases

For a stable, pre-compiled version with a convenient one-click installer (Windows, macOS, Linux), official releases will be available for purchase on Itch.io and Gumroad upon reaching the Beta milestone. This supports the project's development and respects your time.
